### Description
Create a parent class, called BaseModel, to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances\
Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file\
Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel\
Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.\
Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### Environment
Interpreter was developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS via Vagrant in VirtualBox.
